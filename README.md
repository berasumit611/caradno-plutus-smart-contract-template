## üîπ **Beginner-Level Smart Contracts**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Time-Locked Wallet (Vesting Contract)**
   - A smart contract that locks ADA or tokens for a specific period.
   - The funds can only be withdrawn after a set time (using `validityInterval`).
   - **Use Case**: Employee token vesting, ICO fund lockups.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Guessing Game (Number-Based Game)**
   - A contract where users submit a number as a guess.
   - If the guess matches the predefined correct number, they can claim a reward.
   - **Use Case**: Simple blockchain-based games, lotteries.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Multi-Signature Wallet**
   - A contract that requires multiple users (e.g., 2 out of 3 signatories) to approve a transaction before funds can be spent.
   - **Use Case**: DAO treasury management, joint accounts.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **NFT Minting Contract**
   - A contract that mints NFTs based on specific conditions (e.g., only one NFT per address).
   - **Use Case**: Creating unique digital collectibles.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Access Control Contract**
   - A contract that allows only specific addresses (whitelisted users) to redeem assets or interact with the contract.
   - **Use Case**: Private sales, restricted membership systems.

## üîπ **Intermediate-Level Smart Contracts**  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Decentralized Auction Contract**
   - Users can place bids on an item (ADA or tokens).
   - The highest bidder wins when the auction ends.
   - The seller receives the highest bid amount, and the NFT or asset is transferred to the winner.
   - **Use Case**: NFT marketplaces, digital asset auctions.  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Decentralized Lottery**
   - Users submit ADA or tokens as an entry fee.
   - The contract selects a random winner after a set time.
   - The winner gets the total prize pool.
   - **Use Case**: Fair blockchain-based lottery systems.  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Subscription-Based Access**
   - Users pay a fee to receive access to services (on-chain or off-chain).
   - The contract verifies if the user has an active subscription.
   - **Use Case**: Blockchain-based membership systems (e.g., online courses, streaming services).  

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Staking Contract with Rewards**
   - Users lock ADA or tokens in a smart contract.
   - Rewards are distributed proportionally based on the staking period.
   - **Use Case**: DeFi staking, yield farming.  

### üîü **Crowdfunding Contract**
   - Users can donate funds to a project.
   - The funds are only released if the funding goal is met.
   - If the goal isn‚Äôt met, contributors get a refund.
   - **Use Case**: Decentralized Kickstarter-like fundraising.

## üîπ **Advanced-Level Smart Contracts**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**
   - A contract that allows users to swap tokens using an automated market maker (AMM) model.
   - **Use Case**: DeFi trading platforms.  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ **Lending and Borrowing Protocol**
   - Users can deposit assets as collateral and borrow against them.
   - Interest rates can be adjusted dynamically.
   - **Use Case**: DeFi money markets (like Aave on Ethereum).  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**
   - A contract that enables governance decisions based on token voting.
   - Proposals can be submitted, and token holders vote on-chain.
   - **Use Case**: Community-driven project governance.  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ **Identity Verification (DID - Decentralized Identity)**
   - Users store verified credentials on-chain.
   - Contracts validate user credentials before allowing access to services.
   - **Use Case**: KYC on blockchain, reputation systems.  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ **Tokenized Real Estate Ownership**
